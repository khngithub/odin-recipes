        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice noodles into a large bowl and cover with several inches of room temperature water; let soak for 30 to 60 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Whisk 1/2 cup sugar, vinegar, fish sauce, and tamarind paste together in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in eggs; scramble until eggs are nearly cooked through, about 2 minutes. Add chicken and rice noodles and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in tamarind mixture, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and salt; cook until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in peanuts and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with bean sprouts, chives, and paprika; serve with lime wedges.</li>

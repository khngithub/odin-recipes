        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Good ol' chicken soup, easy to make. Best for hangover.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
            <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
            <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard skin and bones.</li>
            <li>Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.</li>
            <li>Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.</li>
        </ol>
